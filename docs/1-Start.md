Clone or download using npm. Either way, I'm going to end removing
the `bin` script(s) from the repo. Reason being, the
docs for this repo will eventually have a script you can plug into 
your own bin, and you can `npm link` your own cli. I just think 
that makes more sense than globally installing a personal cli.
